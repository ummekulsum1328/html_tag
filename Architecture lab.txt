A Multiplexer is a device that allows one of several analog or digital input signals which are to be
selected and transmits the input that is selected into a single medium. Multiplexer is also known as Data
Selector.

4 to 1 Multiplexer:

A 4-to-1 multiplexer consists four data input lines as D0 to D3, two select lines as S0 and S1 and a single
output line Y. The select lines S1 and S2 select one of the four input lines to connect the output line. The
particular input combination on select lines selects one of input (D0 through D3) to the output.




8 to 1 Multiplexer:

A 8-to-1 multiplexer consists eight data input lines as D0 to D7, three select lines as S0, S1 and S2 and a
single output line Y. The select lines S0, S1 and S2 select one of the eight input lines to connect the
output line. The particular input combination on select lines selects one of input (D0 through D7) to the
output.
